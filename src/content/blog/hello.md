# Welcome to My New Website

Hello, world. ✌️

This is the first blog entry of my new website.

## How Did I Make This Site?

I'm trying out [Astro](https://astro.build/). It's a solid framework for building fast, content-focused sites. I'm using MDX to mix Markdown and React components. TailwindCSS keeps the design clean and responsive.

## What's in Store?

This site will have:

- **Portfolio:** My work and projects.
- **Things of Interest:** Content that piques my curiosity.
- **Blog:** An archive of my past projects and thoughts.

Stick around for more.
